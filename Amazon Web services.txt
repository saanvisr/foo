Sub nets: Range of IP address  (Private or Public)

Security group functions like a fire wall (Incoming and Outgoing)

Route 53 : TCP

Auto scaling : It increases the Amazon EC2 instance during peak time and decreases the capacity during non peak hours

Load balancer is responsible for distributing the network traffic accross several  Amazon EC2 instances

EBS : Durable storage device attached to the EC2 instance. Four main benefits of EBS. It acts as a primary dta 

1. Data availability

2. Data security

3. Data persistance

4. Data backups

Types of EBS (Elastic Block stoge)

General purpose SSD

Snapshots are updated incrementally, they are deleted in such a way that only the most recent snapshot stays back for restoring the volumen

Snapshots are always restricted to the region where they are created.

EBS data volume can be restored in S3
